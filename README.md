# DNS_Code
This code includes a DNS solver for simulating cavity and channel flow. The solver is written in Fortran. 
The inputs for the desired flow are set through an input file called input.ini, which includes the number of grid points, geometry length, Reynolds number, CFL and number of cores. 
The simulation output is in the form of files, including the instantaneous flow field, the time-averaged flow field and a file containing the velocity fluctuations with respect to time.
